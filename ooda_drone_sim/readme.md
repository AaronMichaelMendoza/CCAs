# OODA

## About

This project simulates a simplified AI system based on the OODA loop: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. It models a combat drone making decisions in real time when confronted by enemies.

## Setup
Create a Conda environment with Python 3.10, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## The OODA Cycle
