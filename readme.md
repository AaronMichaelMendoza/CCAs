# Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) Projects

Welcome to my CCA-focused project repository!  
This collection explores AI, autonomy, decision-making, and swarm control for next-generation unmanned combat systems.

## About

This repository is dedicated to building and showcasing side projects aligned with the future of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) development.  
Projects are designed to simulate key capabilities required by real-world CCA programs, including:

- Autonomous decision loops (OODA models)
- Swarm coordination and distributed intelligence
- Predictive maintenance and health monitoring
- AI-driven tactical behavior modeling
- Human-AI interaction and command interfaces

## Project List

| Project | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `autonomous-ooda-loop` | AI system simulating a combat drone's Observe-Orient-Decide-Act cycle |
| `swarm-intelligence-sim` | Multi-agent simulation of cooperative drone tactics and threat evasion |
| `predictive-maintenance-ai` | Model for early fault detection based on simulated sensor data |
| `ethical-decision-engine` | AI decision-making respecting engagement rules under uncertainty |
| `human-ai-control-interface` | Prototype UI for managing a small fleet of semi-autonomous aircraft |

*(More projects coming soon!)*

## Technologies

- Python (Primary language)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning projects)
- OpenAI Gym / Custom Simulation Environments
- ROS2 (for robotic middleware, if needed)
- Web frameworks for UI prototyping (e.g., React)

## Goals

- Sharpen AI system design and decision-making architectures
- Explore real-world applications of autonomy in contested environments
- Build a practical portfolio relevant to CCA, NGAD, and other defense innovation programs
